# Budget Calendar Project

## The Goal

Provide insight on where your money is being spent.  See your budget on a calendar with the amount of hours required to pay for the necessities and luxuries of your life.

See a break down of your budget via monthly calendar.  Rediscover how many hours are spent a work-week to pay the your mortgage/rent, bills, etc â€¦

See how much you make, spend, and can save on an hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly basis.

Find out how long it will take you to get that item you're wishing for and clearly see what small savings here and there can do to to your wish list timeline.

## The Rules
Enter your income, expenses, and time at work.  We take care of the rest.  We provide useable visuals that will make your time budget and money budget too obvious.

We work hard to require as little information as possible.  Get started without ever making an account or registering your name.

If you'd like keep up with your budget from multiple devices, your phone, and desktop we do require some credentials (email & password).  We have to identify your progress somehow.  :/

## The Reason
It's not yet clear enough where our paycheck goes at the end of the month.  I want a tool that makes it obvious, a tool that anyone can use.

This service focuses on money as it relates to your time.

## Thoughts
* How much of your time is just spent surviving to the next month.
* How much of your time is actually working towards the things you want out of this life?
